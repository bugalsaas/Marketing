# 🚀 Bugal Marketing Website - Vercel Deployment Guide

## 📋 **Deployment Strategy: Two-Phase Approach**

### **Phase 1: Temporary URL Deployment (Today)**
- **Purpose**: Get stakeholder feedback, test functionality
- **URL**: `bugal-marketing.vercel.app` (or similar)
- **Timeline**: Deploy today, gather feedback over next few days

### **Phase 2: Live Domain Switch (After Feedback)**
- **Purpose**: Replace current bugal.com.au website
- **URL**: `bugal.com.au`
- **Timeline**: After final approval and feedback incorporation

## 🔧 **Phase 1: Temporary Deployment (You + Me)**

### **Step 1: Create Vercel Account (YOU - 5 minutes)**

1. **Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)**
2. **Click "Sign Up"**
3. **Choose "Continue with GitHub"** (recommended)
4. **Authorize Vercel** to access your GitHub account
5. **Complete profile** (Company: Bugal, etc.)

### **Step 2: Install Vercel CLI (I'll help you)**

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm install -g vercel
```

### **Step 3: Deploy to Temporary URL (We'll do this together)**

```bash
# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy to production (this will give you a temporary URL)
vercel --prod
```

**Expected output**: You'll get a URL like `https://bugal-marketing-abc123.vercel.app`

2. **Update DNS records** (I'll guide you through this)
3. **Set up SSL certificates** (automatic with Vercel)
4. **Test the live domain**
5. **Take down old website**
