<p>The 2024 federal budget brings significant updates that directly impact the disability sector, particularly regarding the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Here's a concise overview of the key changes and what they mean for you as an independent support worker.</p><h5>NDIS 'Growth Moderation'</h5><p>The government has introduced a series of reforms aimed at slowing the rapid increase in NDIS costs. With spending projected to rise to $60.7 billion by 2027-28, these changes are expected to save $14.4 billion over the next four years. The emphasis is on reducing "intra-plan inflation" and shifting to a needs-based assessment for participant budgets.</p><p>‍</p><h5>New Measures and Investments</h5><p>In addition to cost-saving measures, the budget allocates $468.7 million for fraud prevention and the establishment of an evidence advisory committee. This committee will provide guidance on effective supports for NDIS participants. Moreover, $129.8 million is set aside for consultations to respond to the NDIS review findings.</p><p>‍</p><h5>Impact on Support Workers</h5><p>For independent support workers, these changes signify a shift towards more structured and possibly stringent budget assessments for your clients. Understanding these new frameworks will be crucial in helping participants navigate their plans and ensuring they receive the appropriate level of support.</p><p>‍</p><h5>Looking Ahead</h5><p>The government remains committed to the NDIS but aims to implement these changes thoughtfully and in consultation with the disability community. As a support worker, staying informed and adaptable to these evolving policies will be key to providing the best care and assistance to your clients.</p><p>‍</p>
