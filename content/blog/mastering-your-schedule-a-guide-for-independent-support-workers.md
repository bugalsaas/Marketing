To help you navigate this challenging yet rewarding role, we've created a &nbsp;schedule that ensures you stay on top of key tasks. Here's our suggestion of how to master your schedule:</p><p>‍</p><h5>Daily Tasks:</h5><ul role="list"><li><strong>Complete Shifts</strong>: At the end of each workday, review and complete shift reports promptly. Document any important information or observations.</li><li><strong>Marketing and Networking</strong>: If you have just started your Support Provider journey and have more available time than you would like, dedicate some time each day to marketing and networking activities. This could involve contacting Support Coordinators to make them aware of your availability, reviewing relevant Facebook Groups, or designing marketing material, like a shareable profile.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h5>Weekly Tasks:</h5><ul role="list"><li><strong>Send Invoices: </strong>Choose a specific day of the week to send invoices to clients for the services provided during that week.</li><li><strong>Check Payments:</strong> Allocate time once a week to review your bank account for incoming payments. Ensure all payments are correctly processed.</li><li><strong>Debt Chasing: </strong>As needed, incorporate debt chasing into your weekly schedule, if required. Don't be in a position to have to request payment on an invoice sent 8 months ago.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h5>Monthly Tasks:</h5><ul role="list"><li><strong>Client Communication/Shift Reports</strong>: At the end of each month, compile detailed shift reports for your clients summarising the support provided, any notable changes or observations, and any recommendations for the upcoming month. Share these reports with clients to maintain transparent and effective communication.</li><li><strong>Financial Review:</strong> At the end of the month, conduct a thorough financial review. This includes reconciling your accounts, tracking expenses, and preparing for tax obligations.</li><li><strong>Professional Development:</strong> Dedicate time each month to your professional growth. This could involve taking additional training, attending webinars or workshops, or simply staying updated with industry news and trends.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h5>Quarterly Tasks:</h5><ul role="list"><li><strong>Business Evaluation:</strong> Every quarter, assess your business performance. Review your goals, financial progress, and client satisfaction. Make adjustments and set new objectives as needed.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h5>Annual Tasks:</h5><ul role="list"><li><strong>Tax Preparation:</strong> As the fiscal year ends, prepare for tax season. Organize your financial records, gather receipts, and consult with a tax professional to ensure compliance with tax regulations.</li><li><strong>Goal Setting: </strong>Set clear business goals for the upcoming year. This includes financial targets, professional development objectives, and any expansion plans.</li><li><strong>Client Feedback: </strong>Collect feedback from participants and Support Coordinators through short surveys or interviews to gain insights into their experiences of your services and identify areas for improvement. This will show amazing professionalism.</li></ul><p>‍</p>
