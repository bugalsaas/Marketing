<p>If you've made the decision to become an NDIS registered provider and are ready to embark on the registration process, here is what the journey should be like.</p><p>‍</p><h5>Start your Application:&nbsp;</h5><p>Start your application through the <a href="https://www.ndiscommission.gov.au/providers/becoming-registered-provider" target="_blank">Applications Portal</a>. Provide your organisation's &nbsp;details, business structure, places of operation with key staff members. Choose the registration groups you want to register for and complete a self-assessment against the NDIS standards. Don't forget to disclose any relevant information that could impact your suitability.</p><p>‍</p><h5>Select an Approved Quality Auditor:&nbsp;</h5><p>After submitting your application, you'll receive an email from the NDIS Commission outlining the registration and audit requirements. Depending on the complexity and risk of your services, you'll need to undergo either a 'verification' or 'certification' audit. Choose an approved quality auditor to conduct the audit. Request quotes from multiple auditors to find the best fit for your needs.</p><p>‍</p><h5><strong>Undergo an Audit:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>The approved quality auditor will begin the audit process, typically divided into Stage 1 and Stage 2. They will work with you, addressing any questions you may have about their findings. Once the audit is complete, the auditor will submit the outcome to the NDIS Commission.</p><p>‍</p><h5><strong>Assessment of your Application</strong></h5><p>The NDIS Commission will review the audit outcomes and assess the suitability of your organisation. This includes assessing previous NDIS registrations, banning orders, convictions, adverse findings, enforcement actions, fraud-related issues, and more. The NDIS Commission will inform you of their decision and provide reasons for their outcome.</p><p>‍</p><h5><strong>Receive the Outcome:</strong>&nbsp;</h5><p>If your application is successful, you will receive a certificate of registration outlining the services or supports you are registered to provide, along with any conditions to maintain your registration. In case of an unsuccessful outcome, you have the option to request a review from the NDIS Commission or seek further review from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</p><p>‍</p><p>While the NDIS registration process may appear daunting, proper preparation and following these steps will make it more manageable. Alternatively there are consultants out there who can assist!</p>
