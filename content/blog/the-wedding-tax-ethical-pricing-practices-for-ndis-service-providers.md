<p>There has been growing concern within the NDIS sector regarding the unethical practice of some providers applying what has been coined as the "wedding tax." This term refers to the unjustified increase in prices for goods and services once it's discovered that a customer is on the NDIS. Not only is this practice morally reprehensible, but it's also a breach of federal law.</p><p>As a member of the NDIS service provider community, you all have a duty to uphold the highest ethical standards in all interactions with clients. That's why we want to take a moment to address this issue and emphasise the importance of fair and transparent pricing practices.</p><p>Recently, Bill Shorten, the Minister for the NDIS, sent out a letter to participants highlighting the government's commitment to protecting and advocating for NDIS participants. One of the key initiatives mentioned in the letter is the establishment of a Fair Pricing Taskforce, chaired by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), to tackle illegal overcharging of NDIS participants.</p><p>At Bugal, we wholeheartedly support these efforts to ensure fairness and integrity within the NDIS sector. We believe that all individuals, regardless of their NDIS status, deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. Charging higher prices simply because someone is a participant is not only unethical but goes against the principles of equality and fairness.</p><p>Hourly rates and service costs should reflect the qualifications and experience of service providers and should align with the value provided. Remember, sustainable business practices are built on a foundation of trust, respect, and transparency. If clients see value in services offered, they will continue to support you in the long run.</p><p>Let us all stand together in rejecting the "wedding tax" mentality and instead embrace ethical pricing practices that prioritise the well-being and dignity of NDIS participants. Together, we can create a more inclusive and equitable NDIS sector for all.</p>
