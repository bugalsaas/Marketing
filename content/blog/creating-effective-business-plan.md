# Creating an Effective Business Plan for Your NDIS Independent Support Business

Transitioning to become an NDIS Independent Support Worker requires careful planning and preparation. Crafting a robust business plan is key to your success. Here are some tips to help you create an effective business plan tailored to your NDIS business in Australia:

## Define Your Services

Start by outlining the services you plan to offer. Consider the types of support your clients need and how you will meet those needs. Think about the expertise you bring to the table and the specific requirements of the NDIS.

### Key Considerations:
- **Core Services**: What specific support services will you provide?
- **Specializations**: Do you have expertise in particular areas (e.g., mental health, physical disabilities, autism)?
- **Service Delivery**: Will you provide in-home, community, or remote support?
- **NDIS Categories**: Which NDIS support categories align with your skills?

### Service Categories to Consider:
- **Core Supports**: Assistance with daily living activities
- **Capacity Building**: Skills development and training
- **Capital Supports**: Equipment and home modifications
- **Coordination of Supports**: Plan management services

## Identify Your Target Market

Who are your ideal clients? Determine the demographics, needs and locations of the NDIS participants you want to serve. This will guide your marketing strategy and help you understand where to focus your efforts to attract clients.

### Market Research Questions:
