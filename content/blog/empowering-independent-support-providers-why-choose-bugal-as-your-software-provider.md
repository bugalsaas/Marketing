Whether you work solo or with a small team, you need a practice management software that aligns perfectly with your needs, without unnecessary fees or complexities.</p><p>‍</p><h5>The current options:</h5><p>Perhaps you've tried the marketplace style platforms that deduct a hefty percentage of your hard-earned income (have you calculated what this is every year?) leaving you with less. The harder you work, the more they take and it's frustrating especially when they can be the cause for slowing down the payment process. On the other hand, generic platforms might lack essential tools or you end up paying for features you don't even use. NDIS-specific platforms are robust, but they can be overwhelming for smaller practices without a large team to manage them or the cost is just too much. Or there is just the Excel and Word solution!</p><p>‍</p><h5>Enter Bugal </h5><p>Your dedicated ally in the NDIS support industry.
