Whether you're a seasoned provider or just starting, understanding the basics of invoicing can make a significant difference in ensuring that you get paid promptly for the services you provide. Bugal met with several Plan Managers to identify common issues that lead to delays in payments, and at the top of the list was incorrect or incomplete information on invoices.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h3>Key Information Required on an Invoice</h3><p>Whether your invoice is handwritten or generated by a computer, Plan Managers need to see the following details to process your payment efficiently:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Invoice Number</strong>: Every invoice must have a unique number. This helps in tracking payments and avoiding confusion.</li><li><strong>Invoice Date</strong>: The date when the invoice is produced. This is important for both record-keeping and payment timelines.</li><li><strong>Provider Name and Bank Account Details</strong>: Include your full name (or business name), along with your bank account details—BSB (6-digit), account number, and account name.</li><li><strong>Australian Business Number (ABN)</strong>: Your ABN is a legal requirement on all invoices. It identifies your business to the Australian Taxation Office.</li><li><strong>Participant’s Name</strong>: The name of the NDIS participant who received the service or support.</li><li><strong>Participant’s NDIS Number</strong> (if known): Including this number helps in the accurate allocation of funds.</li><li><strong>Date(s) of Service/Support</strong>: Specify the exact dates when the service was provided.</li><li><strong>Quantity of Service</strong>: This typically refers to the duration of the service in hours.</li><li><strong>Description of Support</strong>: Clearly describe the type of support provided, such as "Core Daily Activity" or "Core Social and Community Access," and include the corresponding NDIS item code.</li><li><strong>Price</strong>: Indicate the rate per hour for the service provided.</li><li><strong>Total</strong>: Calculate the total by multiplying the rate per hour by the quantity of hours worked.</li><li><strong>Grand Total</strong>: Ensure that the grand total is clearly displayed, summarising all the services provided.</li></ol><h3>How Bugal Simplifies Invoicing</h3><p>Using Bugal not only helps you keep track of your business activities and finances but also ensures that you’re employing best practices in running your Independent Support Provider business.
