# Understanding GST for Independent Support Providers: Complete Guide

Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a crucial aspect of running an NDIS support business in Australia. Understanding GST requirements, registration thresholds, and compliance obligations is essential for legal operation and financial success. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about GST for independent support providers.

## What is GST?

### Definition:
GST (Goods and Services Tax) is a 10% tax on most goods and services sold in Australia. It's a value-added tax that applies to most business transactions and is collected by businesses on behalf of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).

### How GST Works:
- **Businesses collect GST** on sales to customers
- **Businesses pay GST** on purchases from suppliers
- **Net GST** is paid to the ATO (GST collected minus GST paid)
- **GST is included** in the price of goods and services

### GST vs. Income Tax:
- **GST**: Tax on business transactions (10% on sales)
- **Income Tax**: Tax on business profits (progressive rates)
- **Separate obligations**: GST and income tax are different requirements
- **Different reporting**: GST has separate reporting requirements (BAS)
